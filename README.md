# Space Origin

Our website uses interactive visual teaching methods using augmented reality. This approach is much better than traditional learning practices such as studying from books or 2d diagrams that will be really difficult for students to comprehend the visual aspects of various planets/spacecraft. After the pandemic, the new ways of learning practices are crucial, and our application enables one such method to the public.
